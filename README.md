# Horiseon-Marketing
<UPDATE> Landing page for Horiseon marketing agency.




What I learned:

I initially had trouble with understanding the commit messages.  As I continued to write the messages for each commit, I gained a better understanding of their use (such as when using multiple lines, they have to have a subject;  I also realized that the commit message applies to all files updated and learned to remind myself to include all changes on all files, or to commit one file at a time for their specific message)

Notes on commit messages: There will be commit messages that have more content in the description that are not related in the head.  This was done up to the 6th commit.  Commit messages after the 6th commit that have a subject will have a summary of what was updated, with more details in the description.
