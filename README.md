## Description

Horiseon is a landing page offering services in digital marketing.  The code has been refactored to match proper HTML and CSS semantics, but kept the design of the webpage as-is.

Both of the HTML and CSS file have been updated.  The majority of the div tags have been updated to more-specific tags.  Comments have been added to confirm the content in the lines of code that follow, and alt attributes have been added for accessibility.  The nav bar has also been updated to make sure that it links to the appropriate section of content.

The CSS file has been re-arranged to match the flow of the content listed on the webpage.  Comments have also been added to divide up the sections, and some lines of code have been consolidated to eliminate unnecessary repetition.

## What I learned:

I initially had trouble with understanding the commit messages.  As I continued to write the messages for each commit, I gained a better understanding of their use (such as when using multiple lines, they have to have a subject;  I also realized that the commit message applies to all files updated and learned to remind myself to include all changes on all files, or to commit one file at a time for their specific message).

Notes on commit messages: There will be commit messages that have more content in the description that are not related in the head.  This was done up to the 6th commit.  Commit messages after the 6th commit that have a subject will have a summary of what was updated, with more details in the description.
